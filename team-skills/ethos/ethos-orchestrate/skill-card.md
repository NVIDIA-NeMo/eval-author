## Description: <br>
Entry point for an AI agent's ETHOS.md — a durable snapshot of what the agent is for, what it must not do, and what success looks like — that locates any existing file and routes each request to the ethos sub-flow that explores intent or writes the file. <br>

This skill is for research and development only. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers maintaining a production agent use this skill as the entry point to create or update their agent's ETHOS.md, routing the request to the sub-flow that captures confirmed intent or writes and validates the file. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [No] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-sonnet-5-5`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), one attempt per task, each run in its own isolated k8s-sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed, decoys avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? Equal-weight mean of goal completion and expected-workflow adherence. <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? Equal-weight tool-call productivity and token efficiency. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion usage (50% of Efficiency). <br>
